# NFLAnalysis
This program takes data scraped off of the Yahoo Fantasy API and converts it into a JSON file for 
a further look. So far this program accesses the API in the accessAPI.pynb file, calculates fantasy point totals 
and then writes the file to a JSON.
***Future Considerations:
    -In the future the data will be used to create visualizations of player performance in the nfl league
    -In the future the data will also include free agents who are not on a team
    -It is unknown if the data will be put in MongoDB
