# Yahoo Fantasy Football Data Processor

This program takes data scraped from the Yahoo Fantasy API and converts it into a JSON file for further analysis.

## Current Features:
- The program accesses the API in the `accessAPI.pynb` file.
- It calculates fantasy point totals for players.
- The output is written to a JSON file for review and further manipulation.

## Future Considerations:
- **Visualizations**: In the future, the data will be used to create visualizations of player performance in the NFL.
- **Free Agents**: The data will also include free agents who are not currently on a team.
- **Database Integration**: It is currently unknown if the data will be stored in MongoDB.
